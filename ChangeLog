Tue Aug 11 20:30:31  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Tried to fix line splitting.  Achieved to make totally
	  broken piece of shit to somewhat working one.  Could
	  still break down if messages to be sent contain much
	  characters that are converted to multibyte utf-8
	  sequences.

Mon Jul 13 19:00:00 2009  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Removed MSN stuff.  It doesn't work with current MSN
	  anyways.  To make it work, much work (e.g. SSL) would
	  be needed and it's really not worth it.

Mon Jul 13 18:07:17 2009  IRCHAT Distribution Generator <irchat@rinne.iki.fi>

	* Generated release irchat-20090713.

Mon Jul 13 17:00:00 2009  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Generated release irchat-20030628.

	* Mask characters to 8 bits in crc calculation and encryption.
          In GNU Emacs 21.1 ?ö is 2294 of which least significant 8
          bits gives 246 which is correct ISO-8859-1 code.

	* Generated release irchat-4.00.

Sun Nov 17 22:40:40 2002  IRCHAT Distribution Generator <irchat@rinne.iki.fi>

	* Generated release irchat-4.00-beta6.

	* MSN code should now work also in GNU-Emacs

	* MSN Gateway implemented by kny@iki.fi

	* Cleanups and minor fixes.

	* IRC protocol messages are parsed already in the process sentinel
	  and passed to the handler as a parsed list.  The original
	  message is also passed since there are about 200 old-fashioned
	  message handlers that are using regexps in parsing the message.
	  At some point the handlers should be fixed so that they would
	  use the parsed message only.

	* Prepaing for 4.00 release that should come soon if beta6 proves
	  to be stable.

Sun Jun 09 14:47:12 2002  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Removed regexp nightmare from the msn protocol message handlers.
	  Messages are now parsed within the message consumer function
	  that is called directly from the process filter.  This is
	  something that really should be done for IRC protocol too
	  some day.
	
Sat Jun 08 21:29:48 2002  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

Wed Jun 05 10:12:42 2002  Timo J. Rinne <tri@iki.fi>

	* Various improvements in msn code.
		- Status line now shows MSN-Status (if any).
		- Mode changes can be inhibited by a variable.
		- We can send typing notifications (if variable
		  is set), but we ignore incoming ones because
		  they can't be trusted.
		- And more!

	* Made a release of the previous snapshot.

Sun Oct  3 13:15:22 1999  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Fixed a minor incompatibility with xemacs-21.
      	
	* Made a snapshot.

Tue Jul  7 20:15:47 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>
	
	* Added cipher-saber.el to the distribution.
	  It is not compiled into irchat.elc, because it's
	  not (yet?) needed anywhere.

Wed Jun 24 23:50:41 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Irchat crypto is cracked because of the poor ad-hoc
	  key expansion method.  Versions 1 and 2 of key
	  expansion should be considered totally insecure.
	  (setq irchat-crypt-version-default 3) is the
	  only way to go and it is now default.
	  Old message formats are still understood and they
	  can be used by setting variable irchat-crypt-version-default.
	  This should not be done.

	* Snapshot

Tue May 26 12:55:46 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Modified irchat-mkdst to use new make targets.

	* Modified reply to version query be somewhat shorter.
	  Old format is left optionalt for orthodox-irchatters.
	
	* Snapshot.

	* Modified irchat-mkdist so that it removes from all 
	  distributed source files all lines delimited by lines 
	  matching "^... BEGIN NODIST" and "^... END NODIST"
	  inclusively.

Mon May 25 11:00:00 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.

	* Also the first delayed send is always delayed for at least 
	  one delayed send interval.

	* Modified makefile so that legal targets are xxx, 
	  xxx-compact or xxx-snap, where xxx can be gnuemacs 
	  or xemacs.

Sun May 24 15:13:24 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Delayed replies to ctcp queries.

	* Snapshot.

	* Made interval configurable.

	* Made optional feature to allow or disallow identical strings to
	  be queued.

Tue Mar 24 11:27:45 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* MULE support (thanks to KASHIMA, Hiroaki 
	  <kashima@nd.net.fujitsu.co.jp>).

	* Snapshot.

Fri Jan 23 10:11:50 1998  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

Fri Dec 12 09:02:12 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Release 3.03.

	* It's now 3.04alpha.

	* Snapshot (essentially 3.03 release).

Thu Dec 11 08:01:10 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Message split now works better.  If variable
	  irchat-message-split-^C-compat is non-nil, also old separator 
	  is recongnized.

	* Snapshot

Mon Dec 01 08:31:01 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

Tue Nov 11 16:21:11 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* 437 handle. (nick/channel unavailable).

Tue Oct 28 09:18:58 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Added irchat-ignore-changes-from-ignored.  Defaults to nil, 
	  that equals to the old behavior.

Fri Oct 24 10:31:34 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Made a 3.01 release and promoted current version number 
	  to 3.03alpha.

Mon Oct 20 09:12:00 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Obsoleted some irchat-kill... variables and functions.  They are
	  still supported, but I hope we can nuke them some day.

Sun Oct 19 19:02:07 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Integrated global-kill stuff and uah-cache.

Thu Oct 16 12:39:12 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Added irchat-Command-kill-by-regexp to ignore messages
	  matching a regexp.

Tue Oct  7 18:03:45 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Implemented new idea key expansion method.  It should be
	  much safer that the old one.  Irchat (now) can automagically 
	  decrypt messages encrypted with either method.  The method used
	  in encryption can be set via variable irchat-crypt-version-default 
	  (1 = old method (currently default), 2 = new method).
	
Mon Oct  6 16:45:59 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Added splitting of `overlength' messages.

Thu Oct  2 08:54:38 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

	* Irchat startup automatically removes virtual penis `___' from 
	  the nickname on startup.  This can now be inhibited by setting
	  variable irchat-autoremove-virtual-penis to nil.

Thu Sep  4 15:25:18 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added variable irchat-confirm-bell-on-channel-message that
	  defaults to t.

	* Snapshot

Thu Jul 10 13:32:58 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-vars.el (irchat-backup-irchat-vars): No backups made
	  if variable irchat-backup-irchat-vars is not set to non-nil.

	* Snapshot

Wed Jul  9 17:01:34 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-handle.el (irchat-handle-join-msg): It now handles things
	  so that "compress-changes" works properly.

	* Snapshot

Tue Jun 17 13:04:06 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-cta.el (irchat-ctl-a-version-msg): Added possibility to
 	  modify version id that is sent to VERSION queries.  See variable
 	  irchat-external-version-string.

Thu Jun 12 00:23:42 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-commands.el: Buffer `.irchat_vars' is killed after save 
	  in irchat-Command-save-vars.  We don't want to have any sitting
 	  locks on that file.  It may make it a bit slower but at least
 	  everything is not necessarily screwed if there are more than one
 	  irchat running in the same machine.

Wed Jun 11 11:14:27 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

Tue Jun 10 15:26:47 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-handle.el (irchat-handle-join-msg): Modified to handle
	  ^G crap in channel name properly.  I really don't know if
	  this works properly or not since it cannot be easily tested.
	  This modification is not in today's snapshot.

	* Snapshot

	* No more timestamps on ignored messages.  Insertions to
	  dialoque buffer now trigger timestamp.  In some situations
	  ping-message can also trigger timestamp, but that's old
	  stuff.

	* Beeps are now handled in irchat-w-insert.  This makes server
	  join messages with channel names like "#42^Go" beep.  That's 
	  bad, but now beep works properly with encrypted messages
	  and stuff.  Those ^G-channels should be processed in join
	  handle anyway, but not today.

Mon May  5 16:00:32 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Version seems to be somewhat frozen.  I made a 3.01 release
	  and promoted current version number to 3.02alpha.

	* Snapshot.  Virtually identical to 3.01 release.
	
Mon Apr 14 09:15:10 1997  Jukka Partanen  <jtp@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.

	* irchat-commands.el (irchat-Command-private-conversation): Don't
	call irchat-Command-join if arg is nil or "".

Fri Apr 11 13:39:00 1997  Jukka Partanen  <jtp@iki.fi>

	* irchat-globals.el (irchat-get-buffer-window-list): Added this
	function.

	* irchat-main.el (irchat-w-insert): Changed to scroll all windows
	the buffer is displayed in.

Thu Apr  3 16:45:31 1997  Janne Liimatainen  <jsl@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.

	* Added smiley.el support. New variable irchat-use-smiley.

Thu Apr  3 16:34:16 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-crypt.el (irchat-init-crypt): Can now be called
	   multiple times.

Sat Mar 29 20:31:44 1997  Jukka Partanen  <jtp@iki.fi>

	* irchat-globals.el: Removed irchat-timestamp-timer and
	  irchat-names-timer. All timers should be included in
	  irchat-timers.

	* irchat-commands.el (irchat-Command-quit): Cancel all timers in
 	  irchat-timers. Also removed some old timer junk.

Mon Mar 24 00:29:54 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-handle.el (irchat-handle-privmsglike-msg):
	  irchat-suspicious-message-prefix or
	  irchat-defected-message-prefix can be also in notices.

Thu Mar 20 11:23:23 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-handle.el (irchat-handle-notice-msg): Added
	  irchat-notice-cleartext-hook.  Virtually identical behavior
	  to irchat-privmsg-cleartext-hook.

Wed Mar 19 19:13:33 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Implemented irchat-handle-432-msg (ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME).
	  Wow, typo in protocol.  (should be erroneous)

Tue Mar 18 13:55:33 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added irchat-error-prefix in order to match Cletus' nitpicker
	  artistic eye :).

	* irchat-vars.el added irchat-suspicious-message-prefix and
	  irchat-defected-message-prefix.  They are added into buffer 
	  before messages.  Both default to "".

	* irchat-misc.el (irchat-ignore-this-p): Fixed to understand also
	  regexps in the nicks in kill-list.  Regexps have to be perfect
	  matches however (i.e. _foo or foo_ is not ignored by entry
	  "foo" but are ignored by entry ".*foo.*")

Tue Mar 18 12:55:34 1997  Jukka Partanen  <jtp@iki.fi>

	* irchat-vars.el irchat-filter.el: Fixed irchat-debugmsg
	documentation and use in irchat-filter.

	* irchat-commands.el (irchat-Command-debug): Be more sensible
	about windows.

Mon Mar 17 13:02:26 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.
	
	* Fixed a stupid typo irchat-format-string3-p ->
	  irchat-format-string3-e.

Sun Mar 16 20:18:17 1997  Tomi Ollila  <too@iki.fi>

	* irchat-dcc.el (irchat-Command-dcc-send): This function
	  can now be called noninteractively also.

Sun Mar 16 16:15:18 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.

	* irchat-globals.el (irchat-userathost-type): Variable now shows
	  authentication level of userathost.  Can be 'ok 'not-verified
	  'fake or 'invalid.  Current internet usually seems to give
	  'not-verified.  Stupid "~" or "^" is removed automatically from
	  irchat-userathost.  Are there any other possible prefixes?

Fri Mar 14 17:43:33 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Fixed timer code in irchat-main.  It was total crap.  Now it's
	  maybe a bit less crap.

Fri Mar 14 00:47:39 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot.

	* irchat-inlines.el (irchat-update-user): Fixed to understand +v
	  users (+) as well as +o users (@). 

	* irchat-main.el (irchat): irchat-timers list is now initialized
	  here instead of in defvar.  In defvar it is now defaulted to nil.
	  User can append something into it and here we append defaults
	  to the list if it has not been done before.  Should work.
	  BTW It's quite ultrastupid idea to store these `default' and
	  `running' timer items in the same list and initialize them with
	  some mapcar kludge.  Didn't touch it though.

Thu Mar 13 22:40:02 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added idle mechanism.  Idle is reseted (irchat-reset-idle) in
	  irchat-send.  Keepalive calls (irchat-ping-if-idle) that sends
	  PING (irchat-Command-ping) to server if connection has been idle
	  for over 2 minutes.

Thu Mar 13 XX:XX:XX 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* AT SOME POINT HERE JTP ADDED SOME INFO-PREFIX STUFF BUT DID NOT
	  THINK IT WAS WORTH CHANGE LOG ENTRY.  HE ALSO MADE SNAPSHOT.

	* ALSO JSL MADE SOMETHING.  WRITE THESE ENTRIES!
	
Wed Mar 12 16:34:41 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-misc.el (irchat-ignore-this-p): If function
	  irchat-custom-ignore-this-p is defined it is called from
	  irchat-ignore-this-p.  It gets nick and user-at-host strings 
	  as arguments.  If irchat-custom-ignore-this-p returns non nil,
	  the message is ignored, otherwise irchat-ignore-this-p 
	  makes the decision.

Mon Mar 10 15:57:31 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Made release 3.00.

	* 3.00 has symbol irchat_300 in RCS.
	
	* Upgraded "current" release to 3.01 and made snapshot.
	  3.01 (970310) is more or less identical to 3.00 release.

Thu Mar  6 00:26:04 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-misc.el (irchat-send): It now warns the user, if
	  maximum length of protocol message is exceeded.
	  Message is however sent and server is left to worry about
	  what to do with it.  It usually gets truncated.

	* Crypt indicator now really works.

	* irchat-crypt-use-comint-on-passphrase changed to
	  irchat-crypt-secure-passphrase-read and read-passwd
	  is used instead of comint stuff.

Wed Mar  5 15:40:20 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Set irchat-crypt-use-comint-on-passphrase if you want to use
	  comint in passphrase read.

Wed Mar  5 00:14:25 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-commands.el:
	  Fixed 'cleartext option in irchat-Command-message.

Tue Mar  4 17:47:15 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Made snapshot containing recent changes.

Tue Mar  4 15:37:06 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Notice messages are also decrypted.

Mon Mar  3 20:22:20 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Default keys are now set to regexp rather than exact
	  nickname or channel.  Key has to match as a whole,
	  i.e. default key "foo" is not used for "foobar".
	  Have to use "foo.*" instead.

Mon Mar  3 16:26:21 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Function irchat-current-nickname returns current valid nickname.

	* When irchat-privmsg-cleartext-hook is called, variables
	  irchat-current-message-encrypted-p, 
	  irchat-current-message-suspicious-p,
	  irchat-current-message-fingerprint and
	  irchat-current-message-timestamp are defined.

	* Function irchat-decrypt-message now inserts the fingerprint
	  of the encryption key into the return list.

Thu Feb 27 14:16:23 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-caesar.el supports now Japanese rot-47 only
	  optionally.  Default is rot-13 only.

	* Made snapshot containing previous fixes.

Thu Feb 27 12:25:14 1997  Janne Liimatainen  <jsl@iki.fi>

	* irchat-main.el remove tail from nickname in irchat-open-server

	* fixed nickname bug. irchat-nickname is now irchat-real-nickname.
	  Users should still only change irchat-nickname

Thu Feb 27 03:54:28 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* idea.el fixed.  Bug in remove-padding allowed hostile
	  spammer to kill irchat.

	* Released a snapshot containing the fix above.
	
Wed Feb 26 15:21:41 1997  Janne Liimatainen  <jsl@iki.fi>

	* irchat-vars.el is saved periodical (after timestamps) and when
	  quiting.

	* Added timeout to ignores.

Wed Feb 26 12:51:27 1997  Jukka Partanen  <jtp@iki.fi>

	* Added irchat-Crypt-map and changed bindings.

	* Made snapshot.

	* irchat-commands.el, irchat-main.el: changed occurrences of
	  get-buffer-window to irchat-get-buffer-window.

	* irchat-main.el: Fixed scrolling bug in irchat-w-insert.

Wed Feb 26 00:33:26 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* irchat-mkdist: 
	  You can now give the snapshot name as a parameter.       
	  Default is date (e.g. 970225).  Give YYMMDDx (x = a, b, c...)
	  if you are generating several snapshots in the same day.

Tue Feb 25 23:47:30 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* ignore-suspicious now works.

	* Makefile is now GNUmakefile.

	* Added target gnuemacs2 to makefile.

	* Fixed one .el to .elc in the makefile.

Tue Feb 25 23:27:31 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Made snapshot.

	* Added toggle-crypt.  

	* Added ignore-defected.

	* README.CRYPT now in RCS.
	
Tue Feb 25 15:25:37 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added *IRC CRYPT* buffer that contains apparently
	  encrypted messages that we were not able to decrypt.

Mon Feb 24 18:33:32 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Promoted version to 3.0.  All elisp files are now
	  revision 3.1.

  	* Encryption stuff is now integrated.  Test it.
	  See ~jsl/irchat/README_CRYPT

Fri Feb 21 14:56:15 1997  Tomi Ollila  <too@iki.fi>

	* Released irchat-2.54

	* irchat-vars.el: Added code to check whether there is a dcc
	  program available and sets irchat-dcc-program according to that.

Tue Feb 18 14:38:19 1997  Tomi Ollila  <too@iki.fi>

	* Changed most (eval-when-compile..)'s to (eval-and-compile..)'s
	  - now requires in already required files works
	  - earlyer every file that required irchat-inlines had to
	    require irchat-globals and irchat-vars earlyer.
	  - --> removed those requires in all files that requires
	    irchat-inlines.el
	  - irchat-inlines.el is always (eval-when-compile ...)'d in order
	    not to get (require 'irchat-inlines) to the target binary.
	    However, in this case, the defsubsts defined in
	    irchat-inlines.el doesn't work, at least when compiled irchat
	    w/ xemacs-19.14. 
	  - The main point of doing all this eval-*-compile changes was to
	    make irchat compilable without requiring irchat-inlines.elc
	    appear in the target binary. This failed this time... perhaps
	    the `xemacs2' -target below could do this...
	    
        * Added (eval-and-compile ...) around (provide ...)'s too
	  (needed when compiling target `xemacs2' (see below))

	* Added a test target `xemacs2' to the Makefile. w/ this target
	  make first catenates all .el files to irchat2.el and the
	  compiles that. This generates a smaller *.elc -binary.

Sun Feb 16 11:19:37 1997  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Timestamp insertion is now also triggered from ping message.
	  This means that if channel is idle for a long time you may have
	  two (not more) timestamps on consecutive lines.

Thu Jan 30 11:53:15 1997  Tero T. Mononen  <tmo@iki.fi>

	* Changed 353- and 366-handlers to handle split namreply-answers. 
	  The 353-handler collects data from server-replies and 366-handler 
	  prints the result.

	* Support regexps on ignores.

	* New function irchat-Command-save-vars. This function uses variable
	  irchat-saved-forms to list variables whose values it saves to file
	  specified on irchat-variables-file.

	* Did not change version number. This is still 2.54alpha.

Thu Dec 19 18:09:45 1996  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added X-FACE query support.  Similar functionality to
	  userinfo.  With upcoming X-Face support this message
	  should be handled accordingly.  New variable
	  irchat-client-x-face that is to hold X-Face data.

	* Handles now PART messages from newer (2.9) servers (too)

	* Doesn't get stuck when nicks collide in startup (jsl)

	* Promoted version number to 2.54alpha.

	* Added hooks for processing to be done after the message
	  is handled.  These are called after hooks like
	  e.g. irchat-after-join-hook og irchat-after-313-hook.

	* Changed Makefile to require eitger gnuemacs or xemacs as
	  parameter. 

	* Message hooks (and after hooks) can now be either variables
	  containing a function or list of functions.  The list is
	  executed as long as functions return nil.  If all functions in
	  list return nil the message is processesd further.

	* Added irchat-info-prefix (jtp)

Tue Sep 19 23:59:09 1995  Tomi Ollila  <too@iki.fi>

        * Changed compilation order in Makefile so all files doesn't need
          to be deleted after irchat.elc is produced.

	* Wrote identical `require's for all files that is `require'd in
	  a required file, to the files that requires it, since it doesn't
	  work otherwise (does `eval-when-compile' affect the behaviour ?)
	  Confused? So am I. See the `require' -paths and you'll
	  understand what I tried to say.

	* Added one patch from mta to `irchat-w-insert'

	* Separated handling of private notices from privmsgs
	  (no more NOTICEs to *IRC Private* -buffer).

	* Added variable irchat-awaymsg and code to return 
	  away infromation after irchat reconnect has taken place

	* Added *IRC Private* -buffer initialization code.


Sat May 25 22:22:22 1995

        * Irchat 2.52 released.

Mon Jan 15 11:43:37 1995

        * Irchat 2.49 released.
