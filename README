irchat.elc
    A precompiled file for those who don't want to build IRCHAT or
    can't for some reason.  Load this and you're ready to go.  It
    should be usable under either Emacs 19.34 or XEmacs 19.14.

irchat.elc.gz
    A gzipped version of irchat.elc

dcc.perl
    An external program which provides dcc file sending/receiving
    capabilities to IRCHAT. You need to have perl installed in your 
    system in order to use that program. Otherwise you can compile 
    the `dcc.c' that comes in irchat.tar.gz.


Version 3.0 and higher supports IDEA encryption.

Beginners guide to install irchat.

1) in your home directory, create directory `elisp' (mkdir elisp)

2) copy irchat.elc into that directory.

3) then write the following lines in your ~/.emacs -file

--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--

(setq load-path (append (list
                         "~/elisp")
			load-path))

(autoload 'irchat "irchat" "Irchat" t)

--8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<--

and then you are ready to go with `M-x irchat'

and if you want to send/receive files, copy dcc.perl (dcc) in some
directory that is in your PATH environment variable.
